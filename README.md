# Alien Invasion Game

This is a for-fun project i'm working on to improve my python skills. It's my version of the classic game "Alien Invaders", very much inspired by the book "Python Crash Course" by Eric Mathes.  The game is about shooting down an alien fleet as it progresses downwards towards your ship faster and faster, while gaining points for doing so. The game is over when the fleet reaches your ship.
